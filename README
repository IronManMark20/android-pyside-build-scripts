A scripts for building PySide for Android
=========================================

prepare.sh - downloads shiboken & pyside source
env.sh - sets environmental variables for the build
build_shiboken - erases old Shiboken & Pyside builds and re/builds Shiboken
build_pyside - erases the old PySide build and re/builds PySide
build_all.sh - erases all previous builds and builds Shiboken followed by PySide

Prerequisites
=============
* Necessitas SDK
(make sure you have the Android SDK platform 14 installed in it)
* system-wide installed Shiboken
* system-wide installed Python 2.7
* Python 2.7 compiled for Android

Tested prerequisites
====================

I've successfully built this on:
* 64-bit Ubuntu 12.10
* Necessitas SDK with Qt 4.8.2 and the included 8b1 Android NDK

What to run
===========
First create some empty directory, then the prepare.sh script.
It downloads Shiboken & PySide source code with Android modifications
and creates all folders needed for the build.

Then in env.sh fill in a correct path to the Necessitas SDK folder,
something like: /home/user/necessitas

then you are ready to run build.sh, which first builds Shiboken
and then PySide.

Of course, you can also run the build_shiboken.sh and build_pyside.sh scripts
manually, just always make sure to run the Shiboken one first and then
the PySide one.

Results
=======
The resulting PySide libraries are in the stage folder. Enjoy ! :)
